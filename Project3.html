                        <p class="descri2">Cubez is the first game I made entirely by myself. 
                            <br>I created all the assets, whether it be the 3D objects or the buttons. The only things I didn't create were the sounds and the font.<br> So, it's the first project I've done from A to Z without a tutorial, without anything to guide me. Of course, I used the internet at certain times when I found myself in a complex situation. <br>So, this is the project where I had the most fun, but especially the one where I learned the most, because I explored a lot and tried not to rely on my past experience. The game is a very simple puzzle game where you have to reach the end of the level. You pass through squares that allow you to accumulate points. The faster you finish the level and the more squares you collect, the more points you get. The goal is to aim for the gold medal. <br>The game consists of 5 levels with different atmospheres. I tried to create atmospheres from simple 3D objects and lighting effects. <br>During the creation of this project, I learned a lot, whether it was C#, Unity, or even Photoshop for some visuals. I invite you to discover the game on its itch.io page.
