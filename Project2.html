                            “6FACE6” is the first game I developed using Unity, so I was motivated to create a game and searched for a tutorial to learn video game development, which I found again on YouTube.<br> I then started and learned C# and the Unity game engine. It's the first game I created, so I followed the tutorial to the letter while taking some liberties, but the game remains very basic and closely resembles the tutorial's version.<br> However, the version currently available is not the first version, as I added levels and patched certain things.<br> In the meantime, I had time to start a second project that I'm finishing as I write this. <br>This little game is simple but allowed me to start on a good foundation. Have fun
