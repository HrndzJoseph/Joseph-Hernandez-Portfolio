                            I wanted an original way to present my work, and at that time, I did not know how to code, which allowed me to take my first steps into computer development. <br>So I decided to create a website from scratch, both the code and the UI/UX design.
<br>I found a 6-hour video on YouTube that was a complete course for making a website using HTML and CSS. <br>I learned a lot, and at the end of the course, I felt ready. So I designed my site on Figma and then coded it completely. <br>After a few small corrections (actually, more than a few), I got a result that I like, and I find it quite original.<br> I sincerely hope that you enjoyed browsing the site because I did.
